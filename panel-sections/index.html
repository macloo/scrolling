	<p>The minute I heard my first love story,<br>
	I started looking for you, not knowing<br>
	how blind that was.</p>

	<p>Lovers don't finally meet somewhere,<br>
	they're in each other all along.</p>

	<div class="poem">
	<p>Spiritual joys come only from solitude,<br>
	So the wise choose the bottom of the well,<br>
	For the darkness down there beats<br>
	The darkness up here.<br>
	He who follows at the heels of the world<br>
	Never saves his head.</p>

	<p>Secretly we spoke,<br>
	that wise one and me.<br>
	I said, Tell me the secrets of the world.<br>
	He said, Sh ... Let silence<br>
	Tell you the secrets of the world.</p>

	<p>Your love lifts my soul from the body to the sky<br>
	And you lift me up out of the two worlds.<br>
	I want your sun to reach my raindrops,<br>
	So your heat can raise my soul upward like a cloud.</p>

	<p>A strange passion is moving in my head.<br>
	My heart has become a bird<br>
	which searches in the sky.<br>
	Every part of me goes in different directions.<br>
	Is it really so<br>
	that the one I love is everywhere?</p>
